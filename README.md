# Human-Activity-Recognition
This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying. This dataset is collected from 30 persons(referred as subjects in this dataset), performing different activities with a smartphone to their waists. The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone. This experiment was video recorded to label the data manually.

## How data was recorded:
By using the sensors(Gyroscope and accelerometer) in a smartphone, they have captured '3-axial linear acceleration'(tAcc-XYZ) from accelerometer and '3-axial angular velocity' (tGyro-XYZ) from Gyroscope with several variations. The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

## Attribute Information:
For each record in the dataset it is provided:

Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.<br>
1.) Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.<br>
2.) A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.<br>
3.) Its activity label.(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)<br>
4.) An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.<br>
